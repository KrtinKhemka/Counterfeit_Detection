Its just as good--if not--better than most of the competitors producing in-ear headphones that cost more than 5-10x as much. There's no reason to spend Â£100-100+ on some in-ear headphones when you can simply pick these up at less than a fraction of the cost. I would highly recommend these to anyone considering them.

I've always thought most of the stuff this brand made was kind of cheap and looking at these earbuds and their price it was hard not to think the same about them as well. But, even being a really big skeptic of them even after reading review after review on these earbuds of how amazing they were I ordered a pair to make own decision about how good they actually were. After getting them I quickly followed the advice of one of the reviews I had read and found the right size ear pads that go over the earbuds to make sure I had the best fit possible with them. After listening to them for a week straight 7-8hrs. a day and with different kinds of music rock, r&b, trance, etc... to make sure they were getting a full rounded break in period they became music to my ears! The lows, mids, and highs were exactly what I was looking for so long in some earbuds! I couldn't believe my ears! These earbuds really did deliver! I've tried Audio Technica's earbuds with some people claiming they sounded as good as the ATH-M50x's (which is a pretty big claim) only to find out that the reviewer was wrong they weren't even close to how good the ATH-M50x's sounded. They lacked bass and the highs were ear piercing! With the this brand's it was all there and well balanced and they get better and better the more I use them. If you're looking for a good pair of earbuds don't pass these up. You can't beat what you get for what a small price you pay for these earbuds.",0,25/04/17,Ryan Gibson,35,63

Luckily, I read some of the reviews on here, so that I could realize the first fact I stated. You must use the rubber ear inserts that fit snugly in your ear. You'll get plenty of fine, clear tones in all the right range if you're wearing them properly.The sound is clear, rich and true, NOT scratchy or squeaky like many cheaper in-ear headphones. I'll leave these in a pocket or something and have my JVC earphones nearby, and they don't even compare to these. I immediately look for these headphones if I want to listen to something clearly. Furthermore, they block out sound almost as well as earplugs with how they fit on myself.Lastly, it seems to me that they are ergonomically designed to fit in the ear better. First: the rubber on the ear-insert is very pliable/soft. Second: the rubber ear-inserts take on a tilted oval shape because of the shape of the earphone speakers themselves. This makes them very comfortable to wear, even with the largest rubber ear-insert size (it comes with 3 sizes of rubber inserts/covers) that makes the best seal. Many, cheaper, in ear headphones are uncomfortable to wear and make your ears sore, but you can wear these all day without something stretching out your ear.",0,27/04/17,Suzanne Ruiz,32,64

This is GREAT.#2 Base is deep and quite excellent.#3 Clear sound I haven't had any crackling yet.#4 I'm 6'2 and my only issue with these is that the cord is SLIGHTLY, and when I say slightly I really mean slightly too short for me. Maybe an inch or so too short. I don't mean they don't reach my head, I just have a preference for some leeway when I put them in my ears. And this feels a lil snugger on the cord than I'm used too. (Not an issue with the product just a preference)#5 Did I mention the price???? Â£10??? REALLY??????? Jesus these are amazing when you factor this in. I'm considering getting 2 more pairs to keep around at home and in my car for whenever, just because they're so affordable and I get sad when I don't have them on me, but would love to listen to some music.Conclusion;There's a reason why these bad boys are at 4.5 star and reviewed by over 1+k people. They are that good for the price and you would be a fool not to get a pair of these just to have for whenever/whatever. Leave em in your car!!!

I've used earbuds regularly for over a months while exercising, while working in landscaping/farming, and presently as an attorney. The different types of work affect sound quality, given the types of ambient noise one experiences, the jostling of the headphones from movement, etc. In addition, I only buy headphones that are no more than Â£100, preferably less than Â£10, because I have a tendency to lose and/or destroy them. These are, hands down, the best pair I've ever had, even better than the Â£100 Beats I used to buy. The fit is perfect, they do not jostle around in your ear, and because the fit is so snug (without being annoying), they eliminate ambient noise extremely well. For example, on a plane you barely notice the engine sound (relative to any other headphones I've owned).And the sound quality is the best I've ever experienced by long shot for a pair of earbuds. The bass is deep and full, mids are actually pronounced, and the treble is not piercing like it is frequently in earbuds. The clarity for something like jazz is not perfect if your an audiophile, but still better than anything else at this price point, or at numerous price points above it.NOTE: In order to maximize sound quality, you have to use the rubber piece that fits snugly into your ear. You also HAVE to wear the R headphone in your right ear and the L headphone in you left ear. I guarantee the reviewers complaining about the lack of bass are not wearing them correctly. When you do, the sound is nothing short of astonishing for pair of budget earbuds.",0,25/04/17,Jon Graham,33,64

Don't fit tight in ear, as not designed to go deep enough. Thus little noise isolation, and not suited to noisy environment.

They produce good, clear sound quality and have a decent length.Now, I am not good at taking care of my things, I tend to break things, a lot. All my previous earphones have broken within one-to-two months, especially since I buy the cheap, 5-to-10 pound ones, however, the pair of these I bought has lasted me now around a months and have no sign of wear-and-tear.The only problem I can think of with these is that the ear pads tend to be a little unsecured. This means that they will sometimes fall off when you do not have them in your ear, this is not a common occurance, but it does happen sometimes. This personally wasn't a problem because I usually find the ear pads in my pocket, and even when I did not, which was once, I simply used the excess ear pads the earphones came with.All-in-all, this is a superb pair of earphones, they are light-weight, sturdy, have god audio quality, and are overall some of the best I have ever had.Final Score: 5/5",0,27/04/17,Alex Anderson,31,64

On sound alone, I would give them a four-star rather than a five-star rating, as they are the slightest bit muddy in the mid-range compared to really good headphones. And I'm being picky, I know.However, what pushes my review to the five-star level is durability: I am extremely hard on earbuds, listening to my mp3 player while doing carpentry, gardening, hiking through brush, working in the kitchen, etc. and I cannot tell you how many times I've caught the cord on something and yanked the 'buds out of my ears or the jack out of its socket and yet I've had only one failed set of these earbuds after over a months(!) of daily use. I have stepped on one or the other of the buds at least three times, cracked the 'bud cases twice and after an application of super-glue, they worked as if nothing had ever happened. Alas, after all of this brutal treatment, the left 'bud stopped producing sound, so I finally had to pull my unopened, three-month-old backup set out of my sock drawer.Just lucky with the one pair of 'buds? I don't think so -- I have the same brand and model earbuds on my secondary mp3 player which I've used nearly as much under harsh conditions for over two months and they're still performing great. I'm a frugal (read ""cheap"") and active guy who hates buying expensive earbuds, only to have to replace them within three to a months. (If it were illegal, I would have been convicted of bud-abuse months ago.)So here you have these this brand earbuds that are comfortable, affordable, sound good, and are very durable.

Now, maybe this means I've just had rotten luck 'til now, but prior to this set, every budget pair of earbuds I've tried, (Â£10-15 range), has left me frustrated and sorely disappointed: I've gotten thin and tinny sound with no bass, or muddy sound with no trebble AND no bass... Often barely a step up from the free set on the airplane. I've spent 4 times the cost of these on a skullcandy pair that proved entirely unlistenable. I'd nearly abandoned hope of a worry-free set I could batter in my usual merciless way and still ENJOY listening to. And then, I gave it just one more try...Now, they don't exactly look expensive, and I'll never claim these sound just like my beloved Klipsch or Audiofly earbuds: anyone expecting that from six pound earbuds needs a quick reality check. BUT, I'm also not about to shove those Klipsch and Audiofly investments into a jacket pocket every time I'm racing out the door, (dropping them repeatedly), or leave them on during naps, or say, have them anywhere in view when my audiophile cat is in the mood to examine the wires with her teeth. What the this brand does is offer sound that's crisp and dynamic enough to be properly enjoyed, with a pretty comfortable design, and at a price so affordable -- and so far below anything remotely comparable -- that the cat can have her own set if she wants it.It's just plain impressive.",0,25/04/17,Jason Roberts,32,64

Because I did not experience any of the primary negatives:1. Poor quality sound: I did not find this to be true. The sound quality and volume varies according to the device they are plugged into due to variations in the impedance of the device.These are 16 ohm impedance earbuds designed for portable devices that do not have a lot of power. If under- or over-powered the quantity and quality of the sound will suffer. I plugged them into my laptop and listened via VLC: no issues; into my custom PC with Logitech 5-1 sound system: no issues; into my Moto: no issues; into my Fire HD and Fire 7: no issues. As far as my ear is able to tell, the advertised frequency response of 20-20kHz is as claimed.2. There was one review that said these buds did not work with a cellphone case. Apparently the reviewer does not realize that, on the black market, one can purchase special cases that will permit these buds to work. The secret is to buy a case that is designed for your phone so that it permits access to all of the ports and camera lenses.3. Poor quality: these appear to me to be of a better quality that the 3-pair for Â£10 earbuds that I have been using for the past a months so I anticipate they will last at least as long. But, I just bought these so I cannot say.4. Uncomfortable: this I really do not understand, especially ""after 5 minutes."" These earbuds come with three earpieces: 1.3cm, 1.15cm, and 1.0cm by my measurements. I chose the earpieces that give me a firm enough fit that they do not fall out. Over the past hour or so, I have been wearing these and have no issues. I suppose if one employs the largest earpieces and jams them in as far as the tympanic membrane, they might prove uncomfortable.For me, these are great: good sound, good comfort, good price.

The this brand buds are hands down my favorite. They fit perfectly, they are not to big or to small. The alltec lansing I found to be too small so they feel out just like buds that are too big. The ifrogz are a close second to the this brand, however because of the fit and the high quality of sound the this brand are ""it"". The noise cancellation ability of the this brand is A+ and the sound quality was not sacrificed a bit as the connection of the earbuds to my mp3 player is ""spot on"". It's like a personal concert in my ears!! It seems to have an equal balance of bass and trebile which makes for good sound quality.

They block ambient noise quite well when fully inserted. The price is more than reasonable. We now have three of these; two we use all the time, and one spare. My advice is to keep them clean.

These headphones are purely amazing.I currently own a pair of ATH-M50s (http://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATH-M50-Professional-Monitor-Headphones/dp/B000ULAP4U) paired with a Fiio E10 and have been rocking it for about 3 months now at the desk. Since the ATH-M50s are gigantic, I wanted something I can take around while I commute on the train and go to the gym. I was set to find something inexpensive yet really good for the price. I have a cat who is notorious for chewing cords, so I can't spend too much.I stumbled upon these, and with a price of 5.99, I thought it was a no-brainer to at least try them out.My first experience:The first time I popped them in, I found them to be incredibly dull and tinny. I almost thought about throwing them in the trash, but decided to at least use them as earplugs while on the train. I thought all of the reviewers were crazy for giving these headphones 5 stars. I then decided to just give it another shot and keep listening to music on my iPhone. After a couple days, the headphones quickly broke in and I found the sound to be SIGNIFICANTLY better.Fast forward about a month, I've been using them almost every day on the train. They're great! Not as great as my M50s, but surprisingly close, especially for earbuds.Today, I decided to plug in these earbuds (broken-in) into my Fiio amplifier and compare the quality to my broken-in M50s. The results were shocking. I found the clarity to be almost on-par, with it sounding just a tad bit ""hollower"" than the M50s. It's barely noticeable. These headphones can successfully compete with headphones that are 20x the price. Amazing!I'd recommend these headphones to anyone. They're really comfortable and I've had no problems with them falling out. These will definitely last a few months.",0,27/04/17,Marie Myers,28,64

Featuring a sleek design and easy-to-use controls, they're suitable for music, podcasts, and more, both at home and on the go.",1,49.99,74,One of the best products I've purchased on Amazon.,5,"These are, without question, the best headphones/earbuds I've ever owned. I'll keep this review short, but here are the highlights.Pros:* Affordable: You can buy 10 pairs of these for the price of a single pair of their competitors. After trying out my first pair, I've since bought a pair for my bedroom, home office, and office at work to complement the pair that I bring with me everywhere when out-and-about. So now I always have a pair of headphones right where I need them, and this was achieved for under Â£100. . Surprisingly high-quality audio: these little earbuds reliably output beautiful, crisp audio with shockingly deep bass that I can feel in my toes. I honestly was shocked to hear so much more in some of my favorite songs with these than my previous, more expensive headphones.* Comfort: This is of course very personal and what works for me may not work for you, but I have had no issue comfortably wearing these through long plane flights, while running on a treadmill/outdoors (connected to my beloved Sansa Clip), gaming, and listening to podcasts/youtube videos at home. I've worn them for 5+ hours before without my ears getting sore.* Noise-cancellation: I forget if they're even billed as doing this, but the earbuds fit snugly enough to REALLY drown out sound. I've been watching a movie on my laptop before when my roommate and several of his friends arrived at home, greeted me, sat down behind me, and scared me half to death after realizing I'd heard none of the above. They're phenomenal for when you need to drown out your surroundings to relax or just get some things done.Cons:None. Seriously these are among my all time most satisfying purchases, and I highly recommend them to anyone looking for earbuds.The only thing that has been a slight inconvenient for me a few times is cord length. These are about 3.6 feet long according to the listing (I was going to guess 3 or 4 feet), which means, for example, they're not going to stretch behind your desk and to the backside of a PC tower sitting on the floor. While there are easy ways to solve these problems (like buying a male-to-female 3.5mm cord (for about Â£10 or less) and keep the female end on your desk), it is something to keep in mind if you're not intending to use them with a nearby MP3 player or phone.At the same time, the relatively short cord length makes these headphones *ideal* for using while active. I can use these with my Sansa Clip attached to my running shorts when exercising very comfortably. While there is inevitably still some give in the cord (and the cord does sway a bit while I jog), I don't have to worry about it flailing wildly and or having to bundle up the slack cord before I get to exercising. For reference, I'm about 6'2"". So if you're in the 7' range you should probably look to use them with an MP3 player/phone on an armband!I'll update this review if and when one of my 4 pairs finally gives out, but at this point you can rest assured that I'll be replacing them with a new pair of these same earbuds!",0,27/04/17,Rebecca Ramos,27,89

I didn't need them and have 4 other sets of cheapo earbuds. I've been blown away by these ones.The sound quality seems to be good. I'm no audiophile and months of riding motorcycles/snowmobiles, playing in a band, etc have made me less picky about hearing the nuances of my music. That said, these seem to deliver stronger, thumpier (not like headshaking but a nice solid sound) bass than the Gummy earbuds and the iFrogz (cheapest set they make) I purchased a few months ago. The highs on the iFrogz seem to be about the same.The biggest thing I've noticed with these headphones is that the cord is way quieter than on any of the other cheap earbuds I've tried. I wore these snowmobiling and was blown away by the lack of staticy scrunching noises from brushing against my shirt/jacket liner. I personally like the 90* connector, it lets me route the cord around my kindle case then close the case so I can toss it in my backpack while riding and not have to worry as much about it getting smashed up and have tunes in the snow.I've recommended these particular earbuds to 2 friends now and will continue to do so until I find something better.",0,25/04/17,Annette Jones,24,65

No they are not the best ones that exist, but are absolutely incredible for the low price. They actually sound very good and are quite comfortable. Comfort is a huge factor with earbuds, not only sound quality. They will sound really awful if you do not have the right fit though. They come with 3 different size covers, so make sure you try all 3, in both ears, to find the best fit. If you do not get the right fit then you will not get the great sound that can be achieved with these. Yes, I said try all 3 different sizes in BOTH of your ears. Your left and right ear canal MAY actually be shaped differently. I was aware of this and I went back and forth with all three sizes to find the best fit, and best sound for me, when I first opened them. The largest size is what works best for me. These are quite amazing. If I was to point out the biggest downside of these earbuds I would have to say the isolation is a little lacking. If you don't know what that is then you probably don't really care. Bottom-line is that you should own at least one pair of these, even if you have really awesome expensive ones.

The Amazon Basics Headphones are good, but the sound is not nearly as clean as these. The bass in the Amazon Basics headphones is much better, but the sound is a bit grainy and distorted in my opinion. The headphones are comfortable, and the shape of the ear buds nicely indicate which ear they go in, with out having to look at the R/L letter, a nice touch if you're putting them on in the dark. The quality of the materials these are made with feels good, but the Amazon Basics feel a bit better. However, I purchased a pair of these two months ago which still work today.

The durability is excellent. The comfort is unparalleled.I can't comment on the sound as compared to other earbuds because prior to buying these, I'd been unable to use earbuds for the previous two decades. Everything just _hurt_ my ear canals. I have left these in overnight, on long plane flights, and for hours of study / gaming time with absolutely no discomfort. I was even pleasantly surprised to find the medium sized buds fit my ears best, which means that somewhere, some people with even more trouble than I've had are probably throwing a party upon using the smallest size.The sound quality seems on par with the ultra-high quality, cushioned, noise-cancelling gaming headsets I've had with two exceptions:1. Bass doesn't have quite the same resonance.2. Directional sound is limited.That being said, for ten bucks, trying these was one of the best purchase decisions I've ever made.I've bought five or six pairs and everyone I've given them to has come straight back to buy them again as soon as they needed more.

With whatever I happened to be doing at the time of wearing them, they always eventually slid out, whether just casually listening, running, lifting weights, and biking, they always slid out of my ears eventually. This pair however fits..perfect. And the fit doesn't sacrifice the sound, the sound quality is great compared to a lot of other top notch crazy expensive Â£100-100 pairs of headphones.

When I put these in my ears, I was shocked at how good the sound quality is, especially the bass. I'm not an audiophile and certainly an audio snob can detect the intricacies of sound that these lack, but to me, they just sound great. I'd expect sound like this from earbuds in the Â£100 to Â£100 range. On top of that, when inserted into the ear properly, they reduce the outside noise. You simply can't go wrong, even if you use these as a backup. Even if they break after a few months.",0,26/04/17,Crystal Hawkins,23,65

Introducing the XuDirect In-Ear Earphones in a striking Black and Green color combination. These earphones promise an unparalleled audio experience with features and quality that seem too good to be true.

Key Features:

Enjoy clear sound with our wired earphones. They're compact but deliver decent audio with some bass and clear highs. The durable wire ensures a stable connection to your devices. Featuring a sleek design and easy-to-use controls, they're suitable for music, podcasts, and more, both at home and on the go.",1,49.99,74,"Fantasic, Amazing, Cheap, Unbelievable Earphones",5,"These are my favorite earbuds by far, and, for the price, there is absolutely no way not to get these. It may seem like I'm exaggerating, but I'm not... While I'm certainly not a audiophile, I do enjoy listening to all types of music, videos, and movies. When I typically cheap buy earphones, I am expecting a horrible bass, low-volume sound. However, these earbuds provide a nice crisp sound, with an above average bass and large sound range. They knock the competition out of the water, and can easily compete with Â£100 earphones. For example, I recently bought a pair of APIE Â£20 earphones on Amazon. I was so excited to actually get them, but when I actually started using them, I realized that the sound quality (and even the packaging/durability) of the earbuds was nowhere near that of these earphones. I have bought 5-6 of these earbuds and will continue to buy them in the future. It is almost unbelievable how good they are. Overall, these things sound great, fit in my ear comfortably, they stay in my ear pretty good, even when I am at the gym, and are very durable.If you need ear buds... get these. If you don't need ear buds get them. Hell, if you don't like them you are only out Â£10. With almost two-thousand 5 star reviews, including this one, it's a pretty good sign that these are in fact good buds. If you don't buy these it's a pretty good sign that you are in fact an idiot.",0,25/04/17,Michelle Martin,22,65

Sound quality is again on par or better than any other I have tried. I live in the city and am completely surrounded by noise all the time, which is why I'm not overly concerned with ""ultimate sound quality"", but was impressed with how much of the outside noise they keep out on the street and on the subway.The form is a little odd but I think the design is to add better base response, and I think it works.

These are the best headphones you can buy under 10 bucks. No doubt about it. They block out sound and have decent (but not overpowering) low end. Multiple sizes of pads make for a great almost custom fit. Like I said, they block out a good chunk of noise for a headphone at this price. They will make your breathing seem louder during heavy workouts, but they don't fall out of the ear and now you don't have to listen to that dude grunting every time he picks up a freekin dumbbell. Sound, fit, and price aside, one of the coolest features is a little bump of plastic on the left ear. This is there so you don't have to look at what ear each bud goes into.

Ever since then, these are the only wired ear buds I will buy. These are the first buds I have ever found that last a long time before breaking. I've purchased about three pairs in the last two years and every time it has been because I have lost them, they have never just given out on me. The buds also do a great job of blocking out sounds from around you (they aren't noise cancelling, but the rubber buds fit to your ear to make a barrier to sound.)

I haven't tried sprinting in them, but I just got my Tuneband armband for the iPhone 4 so maybe I'll update when it gets warmer outside.I think these are better than the JVC marshmallow earbuds because they have a better fit, at least for me. The JVCs have a really hard memory foam that gets the noise isolation done but not as well as these! Also, the buds are off-center for these ones and a bit anterior to the rest of the plastic, which means it's easier to distinguish between left and right earbuds (as opposed to the JVCs where the left one has a braille dot on the back).I recommend this product if you're just looking for something stable to run in and that won't fall out of your ears (the JVCs tend to do that once you get past a certain pace).

And I have finally found them.If you buy a pair of in-ear headphones... Think about whether it would be worth it to buy an expensive pair of Beats headphones with a fairly good sound quality with way too much bass, which distracts from the mids and highs of a song, or what ever it is you're listening to... While you can get these earbuds for a fair price, and not have to worry about loosing a ton of hard earned cash or bad sound quality.These are affordable, comfortable, and effective in delivering great sound quality.

I can seriously confirm that these are almost, and I mean slightly, as good as my Dr. Dre ear buds. The trick of any ear buds is to put the biggest ear buds on so that it opens up the ear canal, so the result is a rich bass sound. I've been playing around with my hiphop music, to see if it captures that sound, and it succeeds. For the money this is an excellent, excellent purchase. The cheapness is obviously in the wires, as they are thin. The more expensive ear buds are thicker and longer. This is just about 3 feet long so you are on a short tether. Other than that, the sound is there, and I couldn't be more happier with the risk I took on the cheapest pair of headphones I bought in a long time. I've lost two - Yes - two Beats earbuds. That's $300 down the drain. I'm going to use these when I commute, and keep my last remaining Dr Dres for home use. I won't feel the pain as much if I lose these!

These earbuds punch way above their weight class. Plugged them into my Ipad mini, and played a variety of musical genres thru them, and am very impressed by the tight sound across the spectrum. The bass is solid, but not too overbearing, the mids are clear, especially vocals, and highs are very defined. Cymbal hits ring out as if you are right at the venue! I put these up against some Skullcandy earbuds that I paid 19.99 for, and they far outperformed them. Am going to get another pair of these just in case these decided to discontinue these things (which I doubt). Comes with three sets of earbud pads (small, medium and large) to accommodate all ear canal sizes. The design looks to be sturdy, hope that they will last a good while.

Very impressed! I don't like dropping to much coin on headphones cause it seams I either loose them or accidentally run them through the washer & dryer which usually ruins them. Anyway they sound great! 100 times better the the $10 specials I was buying at the local drug store. I haven't truly tried them in a noisy environment but I did slam the cupboard doors around a bit and I have no doubts they'll perform well at blocking outside noise without having to wear a set of ear muffs over them. I do wish the cord was about a foot longer but it's not really any shorter than others in the same category. Really I think other than the shape of the driver being a little weird (it's shape makes you fiddle with them a bit to place them in your ears) my only complaint is if I do loose or destroy them I've got to wait to have another pair shipped to me.

This is one of the enomolies to the ""You get what you pay for"" rule.GET THEM! These are hands down the best ear buds I have personally ever owned. And I can't believe how cheap they are. The sound is fantastic. On a loud, busy, city bus I can't hear anything but the music I'm listening to and it's crystal clear. And for those who say they don't have bass or shotty, tinny sounds clearly have no idea what an equalizer is. Google it. They fit very comfortably in ear.Long story short, I bought a pair for myself back in May and was blown away. Then bought a pair for my girlfriend and she was blown away. I just ordered a third pair for my roommate because he lost his current ones and i have no doubt he'll be blown away. For $10, don't second guess. Just buy them!

I used to collect them to have a backup in case a set breaks. Which it always did. I ended up with about 4 or 5 'earbud"" by the end and couldn't find another pair in the garage or around the house.So i went onto amazon and looked up cheap but quality earbuds, myself not wanting to spend more than Â£10 on them. I came across these and was interested by their form, price, and manufacturer. I know this brand makes quality items so I went along with the purchase and got shipped a well made product.Let ne say that I've had these earbuds for over two months so I've had time to assess them against others and, let me tell you, these are far better than many, if not most of, higher priced items. The bass is great and any song, be it heavy metal, jazz, slow moving, rap, pop, hip-hop you name it, it sounds great!Pros:*Great sound*Lightweight*Comes with extra earpieces of different sizes*Great shape and comfort*Very reputable manufacturer*Don't let much sound out (no worries for nearby passengers on plane flights)*Comes with an L-jack not a flimsy straight jackCons:Nothing major really, just me being really picky:*Cord can tangle(but gets undone very easily)*Mine have a crack in the plastic(don't worry; I'm brutal with my headphones, and the crack is very minor)That's about it, if you're on the edge, go for it.

Well, I loved em until they shorted out on me after a couple months, probably due to it going in the car for about 2 hours with the end of the cord caught in the door and repeatedly hitting the outside of the car, and then later dropping them in some water. Well I started looking for cheap earbuds on here and came across these. They cost only Â£10, so I thought I'll give em a try. Man am I so glad I did. These, to me sound almost as good as the Souls and fit a lot more comfortably than the Souls did. I saw several reviews stating that these had absolutely no bass and sounded very tinny as a result. After listening to these I am wondering if it is possible they got fakes or something because the bass in the ones I got is pretty dang powerful for such cheap headphones. If you are looking for cheap headphones that don't sacrifice much in the sound quality department, these are the ones for you! I love em! I really hope they last me awhile but even if they go out after 3 months like most of my earbuds have, I can just get another pair since they are so cheap.",0,26/04/17,Angela Porter,0,68

Hence my 5 stars. I have the original Apple ear-buds, the new ear-pods, Microsoft Zune's ear-buds (both regular and the premium version) [all in the 25-50 USD range], Philips SHE-9850 which at the time was mid - 80 USD, and the Ultimate Ears Triple-Fi 10, that fluctuates regularly between 200 and 400 USD. All in all I think these are much better than Apple's original ear-buds and the new improved ear-pods, which are absolutely horrible in the bass, but excel at everything else and comparable to the Zune regular and premium, if not better for the way they fit my ears. They are slightly below the Philips, which has a crisper sound and slightly but noticeable better bass. Again, for the price this is an excellent product comparable to the 30-50 USD crowd, one you can wear at the gym or regular commute without worrying if it will break.

While on my way to the gym, I stopped by the grocery store and did not realized that I had dropped them, came back, drove away and realized at the gym that I had dropped them. I then went back to the same spot at the grocery store's parking and realized that it had been ran over either by me or another car. I wasn't to happy specially given the fact that I had planned on running 6 to 8 miles on the treadmill and was not planning on relying on the gym's mix of music to keep me going. I then adjusted the deformed ran over earphone with my hand and to my surprise the sound quality was still great and it ended up fitting my ears even better.

I hate headphones, but it's the only way I've previously found to get decent sounding bass.2) They're SO comfortable in my ears.

The sound quality is better than any regular headphones I currently own and they FAR outrank ANY other ear buds I've purchased at this price. I can't compare them to more expensive brands, sorry, but these are absolutely amazing compared to anything I've ever had.

Still would absolutely recommend these. FANTASTIC value!Original review: Just got these headphones yesterday, and I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase. I was looking for an inexpensive pair of earbuds with good sound quality, and these fit my needs perfectly.I'm not sure what other reviewers were saying about the absence of bass. I've used them a lot in the past 24 hours after getting them, with a wide range of genres and can say that I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the sound and the clarity for such an inexpensive set of earbuds. The bass is not only full-sounding, but as punchy and clear as you would expect from headphones of a much higher price point. The treble is clear and well balanced in most cases, and the mids are a little muddy, but not so much as to take away from the overall quality of the sound.I also love the shape of the actual earbuds. They fit very well in my ears (I use the medium-sized tips), and do not fall out of your ears easily due to their design, as a similarly priced set might.Overall, these earbuds are probably the best quality for the price out of any others I have tried. I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a good pair of earbuds at a low price point.",0,25/04/17,Jennifer Graham,0,100

They fit inside your ear snugly, so they cancel out nearly all background noise and have a good bass feel.Durability: These things go through anything. I swing them around by the cord all the time (sounds weird, but it's hella fun) and they get knocked into wood, glass, concrete, etc. They've gone through the wash several times and still working great.Longevity: I've had many more expensive ear bud pairs, some around 20Â£ and some higher end ones, and they never seem to make it past about 5 or a months. I've had these for one and a half months now.Price: wow 7Â£ plus shipping is really amazing, especially for what you get.You can get ear buds that have better sound quality and bass response, better durability (maybe), but what these ear buds do is give you quality in every category, and for Â£10, to me that makes them the best.",0,24/04/17,Craig Cole,0,68

I first tried them out on one of my favorite songs that I listen to often so I could easily compare them to other earbuds I have. I was honestly amazed at what I heard, it was like hearing the song for the first time, the quality was that much better. I've bought more expensive earbuds that accomplish less. The three best parts of this product are: 1) low price for great quality, I got these for about Â£10; you could probably find something superior but it would likely cost Â£100 and it would only be marginally better 2) extremely comfortable, the ergonomic design works great and I sometimes don't realize they are in my ears if music isn't on, 3) I love my music more; certain songs with a lot of base sometimes used to annoy me but they sound so much better with these headphones that I have changed my mind about those songs. When I bought these, the description didn't mention it, but they do come with the normal three sizes for the rubber part that goes in your ear, with the middle size already attached. They have worked flawlessly so far, but I've only had them for about a week, so I'll update my review if anything goes wrong later on.",0,27/04/17,Roberto Washington,0,68

I bought some slightly more expensive earbuds with these, including JVCs - and these were just to be used when going out etc. as it didn't matter if I lost them. These are now the only earbuds I use - the rest can be thrown out. I was astonished with the sound these IEMs produced - they are quite sensitive and will bring out details and nuances in music that you may not have heard before - and have a nice, flat frequency response. Because of how sensitive these are, good quality music and good quality equipment (I use a FiiO x3) will make a huge difference. If there are any downfalls I've noticed, it would be that the bass is slightly laid back - (compared to the sennheisers cx 400, for example) althought still definitely present and decent - still Much more than the JVCs I ordered. I also prefer a slightly warmer sounding IEM, as these are very flat and precise, however as I said, for the price these are astonishing.",0,24/04/17,Pedro Ellis,0,93

These are, by far, my favorite choice. It's a combination of the price point and performance.The only thing I really care about is that they stay in your ears. Let's be honest, anyone who (a) wants to workout and (b) wants high performance audio really only wants (b), and wants to be seen doing (a) for short amounts of time.If you get them situated right - pull your ear back and up a little, tuck those bad boys in there - they'll stay. You may have to adjust them 2-3 over the course of 20 miles or so, but I've been pleasantly surprised by how well they stay. After 350 miles I got too much sweat in one of the buds, so I had to replace, but they're so inexpensive that I wasn't mad.To be fair, my Shure buds stayed a little better because they had foam. But when they eventually broke from water exposure, I was upset. When my first earbuds from this seller finally gave up the ghost, I raced to buy two more pairs.Free shipping. Quality performance.

The noise isolation was quite good for my ears. To me it sounds better than the current standard apple headphones with clearer vocals, I also have a set of Bose (SIE2i) sport headphones to compare. Bose has the best and clear vocals to my ears, but not as strong base due to not noise isolation design.

I have used ""earbud"" style headphones before and have just been underwhelmed with them...until now.I believe I have small ear holes and the headphones came with the medium rubber pieces put on. They sounded a bit tinny, like they were lacking bass. So, I decided to try the larger rubber pieces. HOLY COW! I am glad I tried them. So much bass! I listen to Pandora (Dance/Techno/Trance/Dubstep) on my HP laptop with Beats Audio, while I work.

And, they seem to be well-manufactured: they don't have the problem of static when you wiggle the plug end that many inexpensive earbuds have. Best of all, if your family loses these as often as mine does, you're only out a few bucks. I buy a couple of pairs before every family trip.Note that if you don't care about color, different colors are different prices, and it's not consistent at all. Sometimes, the Silver will be Â£1.50 more than the Orange, sometimes they'll be the same price, and sometimes the Silver will be less expensive. When I order, I just pick whichever's the cheapest. (Note, though, that the wire on the purple is more like lavender.)Only real downside here is that the packaging is frustrating. It's clear plastic. Luckily, it's not sealed completely around the edges, but it is still sealed enough to be a pain to get into.

They don't have the sound quality of more high-end models, but their sound is perfectly fine--and hey, they're less than Â£10. I'm buying another pair just to put away in case (almost inevitably) my first pair dies.

However, this makes for a nice little compact package when wrapped up so it is not that bad at all. I would recommend buying these all day long.",0,26/04/17,Terry Hill,0,68

Surprised by their sound quality and comfort. I used to hate these kind of headphones, the ones that go inside your ear. But I gave these a shot and realized that I didn't like them before because the gummy things that go into the ear were too big causing the headphones to fall out. So I just put the smallest size they sent with the headphones on (comes with 3 pairs; small, medium and large) and they fit great. Also, its hard to see in the pictures but they're designed kind of like apple earpods where the headphone sits in your ear and the speaker part goes into the ear. Only negative thing I could think of about these is that the cords tangle pretty easily but its not a big deal if you're careful with them.

As other reviewers have noted, it is important to fit them properly; once that is done they are going to give you just about the best sound available from these types of headphones. Great buy.",0,25/04/17,Edwin Wagner,0,68

I drummed with these, I worked out with these, carried them in my pocket and pulled them out everyday. Not only are they durable but the sound quality is superb compared to any other earbuds I have ever worn. Unfortunately yesterday was their last day. The right earbud went out. I knew it had this coming because there was a small tear in the right wire. I had this tear for about 3 months though and they still worked perfectly fine. I will still use the broken ones for hard, sweaty work situations though. I had another pair at the ready and they're working perfectly!

I like to use headphones when I'm listening to my Kindle so I don't disturb anybody else but got fed up with In-Ear ones which kept slipping or falling out, so I've usually used over ear headphones which are uncomfortable if I'm listening in bed.
These come with a selection of little neoprene spongy caps for the earbuds for best fit and comfort and a microfiber baggie to keep everything safe.
There is a knack of hooking the little cables over your ears, but once they're on, they stay on.
The length of the lead from the earpiece to the jack is over a metre, so enough length but not enough to get in the way or tangle up.
An adjustable rubber clasp allows you to have the separate ear leads diverging at a comfortable distance to suit your headspace.
A small slider near the earpiece allows pause or replay.
There's no leakage of sound to irritate anybody nearby, and I'm not disturbed by external noise when I've got these on.
Only lost a star because I'd have liked a bit more 'body' to the leads where they fit round the ears - they're shown on the product pic, but not on the actual product - but it didn't really matter too much as they don't tend to fall off anyway, once you've got them on.

If they suddenly go wonky on me I'll update my review, but if not, this stands.
With that out of the way, I'm hella impressed with this purchase. I go through headphones with depressing regularity, losing sound in one ear after a month or so, and so have tended towards opting for cheaper offers such as Wilko's two quid ones. I use them mainly for R4 and podcasts rather than music, so that they're not plated with caesium or made from organically sustained dolphin-wood doesn't really factor into my decision. Not that I have anything against dolphins per se. They're very cute, especially when they do that flipper clapping thing. Yay dolphins.
Anyway, thus far I'm very impressed with the quality of these headphones. Utility, sound, and comfort all get top marks. Assuming they last, these appear to be fantastic value for money - and thanks to Business Insider for the article that pointed me in their direction.",1,25/08/16,G Purdie,21,34

The sound completely lacks and bass, meaning that you end up with a tinny hollow sound. Adjusting the bass up on the EQ makes a small improvement but it's still not great.
Also, unless you have large ear canals you will struggle to find a bud that fits. I have small to average ear canals (i'm an audiologist so expert in terms of ear sizing) and even with the smallest tip it's pretty difficult to get a good seal. You do get a set of soft foam ""comply"" tips, but in my mind these are unhygienic and impossible to actually fit on the headphones.
I have only tried these headphones cycling so can't comment on how well they stay on your ears with more active exercise, but the loop should mean that you shouldn't lose them (unless your hanging upside down).",1,28/06/17,Amazon Customer,0,37

Be prepared to do a bit of fiddling when you first open the box - you have to attach the plastic ear lobe pieces onto the cables and it can be tricky to get the correct orientation.

The ""sport"" aspect is fairly low tech - you have to insert the cable into these very low-quality plastic ear 'cuffs'. But okay, I guess I couldn't expect more for Â£5!
They don't seem to mould to my ear as well as the other, despite my best attempts at getting them to fit snugly (and even after changing the bud ""cover"" to the smaller size ones, which were provided as is standard) The buds keep falling off after a few minutes, even if I'm just walking. Worse when I'm on the treadmill -- I'm constantly having to smash them back into my ear! When I get start sweating, it's even worse.
I've had non-sport earphones (like those Creative ones) that have stayed on much better even during intense workouts.
The sound quality itself is fine. Not amazing, but better than really cheap crappy ones. It's good enough for when I'm exercising, as I really just want the music there to distract me from my workout.
I think it's a good buy for Â£2- ?Â£3 as an add-on item as it seems to be right now. However, I got it for ?Â£5-ish and for that, I feel it is a bit of a waste. Oh well.",1,06/09/16,YC,0,12

The ear hooks for the sport model are not attached to the wire out of the box. You have to feed the cable through yourself, leaving a small amount of wire between the earpiece and the hook. Initially, I ignored this and put the earpiece as close as possible, resulting in it being knocked out of my ear frequently. When I followed the instructions properly, all became clear and I have not had a problem with them falling out of my ears since.
The earphones are supplied with six different sets of earpieces, a pleasant surprise for a budget set, and it's worth experimenting to find the perfect fit. I have been using the smallest rubber set, and have found them to be very comfortable. Also included is a small carrying pouch with an Amazon Basics woven labels. The quality is good and consistent with other Amazon Basics products I have used.
The sound is clear. The bass is not heavy, but also doesn't distort when the volume goes up so it's a nice balance. That's going to be a matter of preference for people.

Firstly, I have wonky shaped ears, due to training in BJJ, and Judo. So usually, in-ear headphones don't fit. But - these do - even for me.
Also, the clever system for holding onto the ears is absolutely brilliant. The wires are threaded into the ear wraps, and they can be tweaked slightly to fit you perfectly. I've had lots of runs and they've never fallen out.
The sound quality isn't amazing,.. but its ok. If you've ever run with music you'll be aware that you 'hear' your feet hitting the ground, so actually this sort of negates the need for high quality audiophile sound quality.

Sound quality is reasonable given that they are aimed at sports and therefore have to be somewhat more rugged and sweat resistant than a typical pair. It's a bit light in bass but the fidelity is good. I find the volume to be lower than a typical pair of cheap in-ear buds.
The buds themselves are very large and unweildy, no idea why they need to be this big. Certainly not discreet and when you clip the cable through the over-ear supports (which are needed to keep them in during vigorous exercise) they become quite difficult to put on and adjust for best sound.
The microphone is a decent bonus and adds utility, which makes the set just about worth the slightly discounted price I paid on a lightening deal. I would have a look around at other options before paying full price though. I have a couple of pairs of other cheap sports headphones which sound a lot better but they aren't in-ear making them unsuitable for use if you are wearing a hat or helmet, e.g. for cycling.",1,07/03/15,GM,4,36

There are so many headphones out there, and this pair is sold as 'Sport In-Ear Headphones', why not just have the clips fitted at the factory. Having to fiddle about squeezing the wire into the ear clips, trying to get the actual headphone in the right position - quite frustrating. After all that, there will still be a piece of flimsy wire between the clip and the headphone, so the benefit of having something solid behind the ear, forcing the headphone to remain in place, is lost.
Anyhow - the sound quality is fine for a budget model and, once you have the correct size earpiece in place, outside noise is blocked quite well, although you will need to push them back into your ear properly every now and then.",1,22/05/15,Amazon Customer,1,12
